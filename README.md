Use Case1: ATM Machine
Write a Code to implement an ATM replica. Assign initial balance Rs.10000, Cash available in Machine
Rs.50000, PIN 1234. Write a code to execute the same for an infinite number of times as many times as the user wants.
For every iteration ask the user to enter PIN and verify the PIN. Then display the following options:

● After every iteration ask the user to continue. If the user says yes then continue with another iteration else
exit from the program.

Use Case2: Bus Ticket vending Machine
